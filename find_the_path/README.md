# Find the path


An exercise created by me and attempting by me.


## 2 step process

###### 1 generating maps

* Create a map NxN where there's obstacles of different sizes
* Set in a starting point and an ending point in the map

###### 2 generating 

* Find the fastest path from A to B



## After 4 hours

* A simple map generating class
* BFS implemented
* A Star with heuristic implemented
* Bidirectional BFS implemented
* Bidirectional A Star with heuristic implemented
